# react-admin-dashboard v2.0

**Live demo**: 




## Folder Structure

### base folder: /src:

-   **/assets**:
    /icons: SVGs icons
    other assets (i.e. images)

-   **/components**:
    generic components, or components that will be used by multiple routes
    i.e.: form components, tables, cards

-   **/hooks**:
    every hook should be in this folder, and its name should start with the prefix "use":
    i.e.: useSidebar, useQuery, etc.

-   **/resources**:
    -   slugs.js: a list of the routes that will be used in the app
    -   theme.js: an object with the theme structure, colors, typographies.
    -   utilities.js: any utility function, for example "convertSlugToUrl", which is used in conjunction with "history.push" (react router) for redirects and links.

-   **/routes**:
    We have 2 types of routes, public and private.
    public: are all those that do not require the user to be logged into the app, such as Login, Signup, etc.
    private: to access these routes the user must be logged in.
    Each main section of the application has its own route:
    -   auth (for login, signup, etc)
    -   dashboard
    -   overview
    -   tickets
    -   ideas
    -   contacts
    -   agents
    -   articles
    -   settings
    -   subscription
